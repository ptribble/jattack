Jattack
=======

Jattack is a simple game based loosely on Tetris Attack for the Game
Boy.

Rather than falling from above, rows of pieces rise from below. You can
swap a piece with it's neighbour on the same horizontal line. If you
create a run of 3 identical pieces, they're removed from the board.

As time goes on, the game moves faster. The aim is to survive as long
as possible.

Changes in 1.1 include extra points for multiple matches.

Changes in 1.2 are related to packaging
